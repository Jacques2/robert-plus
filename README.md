# robert-plus
Discord Bot with a specific focus on whitelisted Minecraft servers that require an application to join.
## Please note at the present time this bot is significantly hardcoded and a lot of code modification is required to make this workable for other servers


You will need to create a robert.properties file in the root directory with the database settings (regular database and luckperms database):

```
host=
port=
user=
password=
database=
lphost=
lpport=
lpuser=
lppassword=
lpdatabase=
```
